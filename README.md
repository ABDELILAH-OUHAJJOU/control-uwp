## What is ControlUWP?

It’s not a secret that the Windows 10 Settings app is not everyone’s cup of tea. The modern version of the settings control is limited and missing a majority of options you can access in the classic control panel. The new settings app is a monster of a GUI with a lot of wasted space, cluttered and chaotic to the end and many functions are simply ugly integrated.
 
ControlUWP app doesn't replace (currently) the native Windows 10 settings panel but tries to bring at least a little order into it. It bundles the most important locations and recommended settings in one place and you can open and execute many of them in bulk. 

After a few weeks of experimentation work (sense and nonsense of such an application) around the app and concept, I decided to continue this project. The first preview can now be tested. Everyone is also welcome to help and to donate a page of convenient settings.

## Download

- (Latest release) [Download](https://github.com/builtbybel/control-uwp/releases)

#### ControlUWP is fully portable but requires [.NET Core Runtime 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) 
Currently it is not shipped by default on Windows 10 and I dont want to publish it as self-contained (produces an application that includes the .NET Core runtime and libraries,  and all its dependencies), as this increases the size drastically. Some systems strangely enough do not need it where the .Net Framework is already installed. I have not questioned this further.
