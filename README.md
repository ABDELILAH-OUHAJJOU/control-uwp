## What is ControlUWP and why do I care?

It’s not a secret that the Windows 10 Settings app is not everyone’s cup of tea. The modern version of the settings control is limited and missing a majority of options you can access in the classic control panel. The new settings app is a monster of a GUI with a lot of wasted space, cluttered and chaotic to the end and many functions are simply ugly integrated.
 
ControlUWP app doesn't replace (currently) the native Windows 10 settings panel but tries to bring at least a little order into it. It bundles the most important locations and recommended settings in one place and you can open and execute them in bulk. It is completely modular and based on PowerShell scripts. 
Everybody can map his favorite settings as he wants.
